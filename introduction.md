description: The uniqueness of teaching technology

# Introduction

I recently started teaching technology in college.  After spending a many years creating new software systems the technology ideas were thoroughly familiar and second nature. But this knowledge does not instantly convert into the ability to teach others.

The experiences within the classroom made me fully appreciate the challenge of conveying knowledge to others.  The naive expectations about how to teach students were gradually replaced with experimentation and observation.

Many of the principles that I've stumbled upon are common knowledge amongst teachers everywhere, while other principles are unique to teaching students technology. Experimentation and observation can be used to create practices that work in a wide variety of circumstances.

When producing software systems we use agile techniques that rely on constant customer feedback that allows us to make frequent small course corrections.  Teaching students should be based on the same principle.  Start with a solid plan but view every class session as an opportunity to make adjustments.  This constant tweaking will create a far deeper understanding than spending countless hours of rigid preparation.

This blog is a forum for relating my experience as a new teacher to others in the hopes that you might benefit.   I'm also interested in hearing back from you about techniques that you have found effective.

I believe that openly sharing ideas ALWAYS produces a better result than hoarding them.  Together let's create a catalog of best practices for teaching technology.  Send me any content that you would like to be a part of this conversation and I'll figure out how to work them in.
