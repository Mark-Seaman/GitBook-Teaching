# Biggest Surprises

Teaching is fundamentally different that doing design work. Knowing about technology and how to apply it is necessary but not sufficient to good teaching. Here are some of the greatest unexpected learnings from my first year of teaching.

### Students do not understand technology

I assumed that kids growing up with cell phones would naturally have an intuitive understanding of how technology works.  What I found is that students were ignorant of basic computers concepts like files and directories, distributed computing, clients and servers, Front-end vs. Back-end, saved state, algorithms, hardware/software, application installation, cloud services, etc..

Twenty years ago everyone that used computers needed to understand these concept in order to be successful.  Today students are very familiar with how to send messages using applications on their phones but are unaware of what is going on underneath.

To be successful teaching students we must go back to shore up foundations that might be shaky. Teacher need to reinforce concepts like the Files and Directory, Input/Process/Output,  data flow and control flow with each class lesson.  Consistent repetition is required to get students comfortable with these unfamiliar concepts.
