# Biggest Surprises

Teaching is fundamentally different that doing design work. Knowing about technology and how to apply it is necessary but not sufficient to good teaching. Here are some of the greatest unexpected learnings from my first year of teaching.

### Students do not understand technology

I assumed that kids growing up with cell phones would naturally have an intuitive understanding of how technology works.  What I found is that students were ignorant of basic computers concepts like files and directories, distributed computing, clients and servers, Front-end vs. Back-end, saved state, algorithms, hardware/software, application installation, cloud services, etc..

Twenty years ago everyone that used computers needed to understand these concept in order to be successful.  Today students are very familiar with how to send messages using applications on their phones but are unaware of what is going on underneath.

To be successful teaching students, we must go back to shore up foundations that might be shaky. Teachers need to reinforce concepts like Files and Directory, Input/Process/Output,  data flow and control flow with each class lesson.  Consistent repetition is required to get students comfortable with these unfamiliar concepts.

### Lectures Have Little Value

Programming is an activity that requires hands-on experience to master. Listening to someone discuss issues related to programming does not advance the learning of very much.  It is the act of discovering and overcoming roadblocks that causes students to learn.

When I started teaching I spent a lot of time lecturing and the exercises were an afterthought.  Soon I discovered that very little of what I taught was being retained.  I then began building my lessons around the exercises.  The lectures were devoted to training the student on how to overcome the barriers that they faced and solve the problems that were required to get to a valid solution.

This simple change produced a dramatic change in the studentsâ€™ learning. This lesson could be applied in every class that involves programming.  I intend to use this simple but powerful technique to optimize each of the classes that I teach moving forward.

### Skills and Problem-solving

There are two types of knowledge that programmers must possess.  The first is related to identifying and solving problems.  No programmer will get very far without learning how to do system design, gather requirements, debug new problems, understand whether the project will be delivered on time, and setup automated testing. The foundation of all engineering is solving problems.

The second type of knowledge that is important to programmers is related to specific technology skills.  These skills are anchored in the technology choices that are made for the programming language, database, web framework, web services, and other tools.  For example, students may take a class on C++, Python or Microsoft SQL.

The true value to our students is in teaching engineering skills which have a long half-life of relevancy. The technology skills that we often focus on have an extremely short self-life of around 18 months.  Technology skills need to be constantly refreshed in order to keep abreast of technological changes.  Without doing this we are in danger of teaching skills that are no longer of value in the workplace.
