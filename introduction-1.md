# Introduction

I recently started teaching technology in college.  Many years spent creating new software systems made me quite familiar with the issues of technology. But this knowledge does not instantly convert into the ability to teach others.

The experiences in the classroom made me fully appreciate the challenge of conveying knowledge to others.  The naive expectations about how to teach students were gradually replaced with better ideas based on experimentation and observation.

Many of the principles that I've stumbled upon are common knowledge amongst all teachers, while other principles are unique to teaching students technology. Experimentation and observation can be used to create practices that work in a wide variety of circumstances.

When producing software systems we use agile techniques that rely on constant customer feedback that lets us make frequent small course corrections.  Teaching students should be based on the same principle.  Start with a solid plan but view every class session as an opportunity to make adjustments.  This constant tweaking will create a far deeper understanding than spending countless hours of rigid preparation.

This blog is a forum for relating my experience as a new teacher to others in the hopes that you might benefit.   I'm also interested in hearing back from you about techniques that you have found effective.

I believe that openly sharing ideas ALWAYS produces a better result than hoarding them.  Together let's create a catalog of best practices for teaching technology.  Send me any content that you would like to be a part of this conversation and I'll figure out how to work it in.
