# Learn by Doing

It is impossible to learn to programming by listening to someone else talk about what it is like to write programs. This is similar to learning to drive by watching a movie about driving.

Programming is a hands-on activity that requires the student to get an idea and struggle through the expression of that idea. This can not be done except by encountering and overcoming numerous barriers. There is no short-cut.

Every new skill can be learned in about a day of trial and error. In a classroom situation we expect to teach students the core ideas of a new skill every class session. This will speed up the learning required but still require additional effort once the class is over.

Every programming class should be built around the idea of teaching skills and then integrating them into real-world applications. It is this integration that causes the subject matter to jell in the students' brains.

Every class should culminate with the student creating something that they were unable do at the beginning of the class session. This requires students to confront their current limitations of knowledge and move the boundary.

By taking this approach we are able to communicate about 50 specific technology skills in the course of a semester-long class.  Mastering these 50 skills equips each student to embrace a job that requires this knowledge. It is struggle to identify and overcome challenges that truly cements the learning.  The true test of learning is therefore measured by the students ability the create something correctly, efficiently, and quickly.
