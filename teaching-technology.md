# Teaching Technology

The process of teaching technology is fundamentally different than teaching any other subject matter. There are a number of factors that contribute to this.

* Technology is rapidly and constantly changing.
* As applications have become more friendly users have not been required to understand how the technology actually works.
* The internet age has taught us to live with constant distractions.
* The easy access to learning resources has created information overload.
* Because small problems can be solved quickly with online resources we have been lulled into a belief that we know more than we actually do.
* Teaching is often done by lecturing about programming rather than forcing students to do programming.

In this blog I hope to explore these and other issues related to teaching technology skills.
